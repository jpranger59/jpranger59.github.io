    <p>This is my basic webpage this page will talk a little about me and my hobbies. Im not very talkative or creative 
        which is why this is late. when tasked with something that asks for something personalized it makes me go blank and shut down.
        ill do my best with this though with making it a hybrid of things about me and by the end with a form of your own opinions. <br>
        This is the video that helped me make my first pc. i couldnt find a video that allowed embedding so i put a link and im fine with losing points on it.
